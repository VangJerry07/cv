    <p class="heading"><em>Former President of <strong><a class ="vangcouncil" href="https://www.facebook.com/vangcouncilofminnesota">
    Vang Council MN</a></strong></em></p>
    <p class="introduction">One of Kimlong Vang's passions was to make a difference in the community. Kimlong served
    two terms as President of Vang Council of Minnesota, from 2013 to 2016. The council represents the
    different Vang clans in Minnesota. His vison was to unify all the Vang clans.
    <em>"I believe that as one organized organization we can achieve more for our family,"</em> he stated.
    Before Kimlong's term as president, he spent countless hours meeting with leaders from each of the
    Vang sub-clans. He helped grew the Vang Council's memberships from about 25 to more than 35 groups.
    <em>"Kimlong understood that in order for the council to function well, he brought all the key
    players together, listened to their ideas and goals for the Vang Council,"</em> said Mr. Chertou Vang,
    who succeeded Kimlong as President of the Vang Council.
